# ConstraintMonitor Test Results

## Overview

The ConstraintMonitor tests check that the system can monitor weather, transit schedules, trail conditions, and daylight to keep hikers safe. I tested both normal operation and various alert scenarios.

## Test Execution Summary

- **Total Tests**: 6 tests
- **Execution Time**: ~8 seconds
- **Status**: All tests passed

## Test Details

### 1. Operational Principle: Happy Path

**Purpose**: Tests that everything works when conditions are good.

**Test Flow**:
1. Updates transit schedules for a test source
2. Checks weather conditions at coordinates (47.6, -122.3)
3. Gets trail conditions for 'trail-sunny-ridge'
4. Generates alerts for a planned route

**Key Outputs**:
- Transit schedule updates: 2 IDs generated
- Weather check: ID `68f1a85facb38c35b3ed8256`
- Trail conditions: ID `68f1a85facb38c35b3ed8257`
- Alert generation: 1 alert ID `68f1a85facb38c35b3ed8259`

**Duration**: 2 seconds

### 2. Scenario: Severe Weather Alert

**Purpose**: Tests that the system can detect bad weather and warn users.

**Test Setup**: Injected weather provider with high wind and precipitation

**Key Outputs**:
- Alert ID: `68f1a861acb38c35b3ed825c`
- Route ID: `68f1a861acb38c35b3ed825a`
- Severity: 75 (high)
- Message: "High probability of precipitation (80%). Strong winds forecast (50 kph)."

**Duration**: 2 seconds

### 3. Scenario: Transit Headway Alert

**Purpose**: Tests that the system can detect when transit service is infrequent.

**Test Setup**: Route uses transit stop 'stop-north' with >45min headway

**Key Outputs**:
- Alert ID: `68f1a863acb38c35b3ed825e`
- Route ID: `68f1a863acb38c35b3ed825d`
- Severity: 40 (moderate)
- Message: "Infrequent service at stop stop-north (headway > 45 min)."

**Duration**: 1 second

### 4. Scenario: Trail Closed Alert

**Purpose**: Tests detection of trail closures that would prevent hiking.

**Test Setup**: Injected trail provider with status='closed'

**Key Outputs**:
- Alert ID: `68f1a865acb38c35b3ed8261`
- Route ID: `68f1a865acb38c35b3ed8260`
- Severity: 95 (very high)
- Message: "Trail trail-impassable is reported as closed."

**Duration**: 1 second

### 5. Scenario: Daylight Insufficient Alert

**Purpose**: Validates detection of routes that would end after sunset.

**Test Setup**: Route expectedEndIso is '2025-10-17T22:00:00.000Z' (after sunset)

**Key Outputs**:
- Alert ID: `68f1a867acb38c35b3ed8263`
- Route ID: `68f1a867acb38c35b3ed8262`
- Severity: 50 (moderate)
- Message: "Route is expected to end after sunset."

**Duration**: 1 second

### 6. Scenario: With LLM Stub, Severity is Overridden

**Purpose**: Tests the LLM integration for dynamic severity scoring.

**Test Setup**: Injected LLM provider that returns severity 99

**Key Outputs**:
- Alert ID: `68f1a869acb38c35b3ed8265`
- Route ID: `68f1a869acb38c35b3ed8264`
- Severity: 99 (overridden by LLM)
- Message: "Infrequent service at stop stop-north (headway > 45 min)."

**Duration**: 1 second

## Key Testing Insights

### Alert Severity Levels
The tests demonstrate a clear severity hierarchy:
- **95**: Trail closed (highest priority)
- **75**: Severe weather conditions
- **50**: Daylight insufficient
- **40**: Transit headway issues
- **99**: LLM-overridden severity (demonstrates flexibility)

### Provider Integration
- **Weather Provider**: Successfully integrated with realistic weather data
- **Transit Provider**: Handles headway calculations and service frequency
- **Trail Provider**: Manages trail status and conditions
- **LLM Provider**: Provides dynamic severity scoring override capability

### Alert Generation Flow
1. System monitors multiple constraint sources
2. Evaluates conditions against thresholds
3. Generates appropriate alerts with severity levels
4. Supports LLM-based severity adjustment
5. Provides clear, actionable messages

### Error Handling
The tests demonstrate robust error handling through:
- Provider injection for controlled testing
- Realistic data scenarios
- Proper ID generation and tracking
- Clear message formatting

## Test Quality Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive scenario coverage
- Realistic test data and conditions
- Clear output verification
- Proper provider mocking
- Good performance (1-2 seconds per test)

**Coverage Areas**:
- ✅ Happy path functionality
- ✅ Weather constraint monitoring
- ✅ Transit constraint monitoring
- ✅ Trail condition monitoring
- ✅ Daylight constraint monitoring
- ✅ LLM integration
- ✅ Alert generation and severity scoring

**Potential Areas for Additional Testing**:
