## Problem Statement

### Problem Domain: Urban Hiking and Outdoor Recreation

Urban hiking represents the intersection of outdoor recreation and city living, where individuals seek to experience nature while navigating the constraints of urban transportation. This domain encompasses planning hiking routes that are accessible via public transit, managing logistics for day trips, and finding ways to experience wilderness without requiring personal vehicles. My connection to this domain stems from my personal experience as an avid hiker who has spent countless hours planning routes accessible by public transportation in the Boston area, where I've discovered the significant gap between the desire for outdoor recreation and the practical challenges of accessing natural areas without a car.

### The Problem: Transit-Accessible Route Planning for Urban Hikers

Urban hikers face a significant challenge in planning hiking routes that are accessible via public transportation. Current mapping and hiking applications assume users have personal vehicles, making it extremely difficult to plan multi-modal trips that combine public transit with hiking. Users must manually piece together transit schedules, trail information, and return route planning, often spending hours researching a single hike. This creates a barrier that prevents many urban residents from accessing outdoor recreation opportunities, particularly for longer or more remote trails that would otherwise be easily accessible with a car.

### Stakeholders

* **Urban Hikers**: Individuals who want to access outdoor recreation but rely on public transportation for mobility
* **Transit Authorities**: Organizations that want to increase ridership and demonstrate the value of public transportation for recreation
* **Park Managers**: Officials who want to increase park visitation and demonstrate the accessibility of their facilities
* **Conservation Organizations**: Groups interested in promoting sustainable, low-impact access to natural areas

## Application Pitch

### Name: TrailLink

### Motivation

TrailLink solves the challenge of planning hiking routes accessible via public transportation, enabling urban residents to discover and access outdoor recreation opportunities without requiring a personal vehicle.

### Key Features

**1. Transit-Integrated Route Planning**
TrailLink automatically calculates the most efficient combination of public transportation and hiking routes, showing users exactly how to reach trailheads and return home. This feature eliminates the hours of manual research currently required, making outdoor recreation accessible to urban residents who rely on public transit. For urban hikers, this transforms a complex multi-step planning process into a simple search, while transit authorities benefit from increased ridership to recreational destinations.

**2. Dynamic Exit Strategy Planning**
The app provides real-time suggestions for the best return routes at various points along a hike, accounting for user fatigue, weather changes, or emergencies. This feature addresses the critical safety concern of being able to exit a hike if conditions change, which is especially important for transit-dependent hikers who can't simply call for a ride. Park managers benefit from improved visitor safety, while hikers gain confidence to attempt longer or more challenging routes.

**3. Real-Time Constraint Integration**
TrailLink incorporates live data about transit schedules, daylight hours, weather conditions, and trail status to ensure planned routes are actually feasible and safe. This feature prevents users from getting stranded due to missed connections or poor planning, significantly reducing the risk associated with transit-dependent hiking. Conservation organizations benefit from better-informed visitors who are less likely to require emergency assistance.

## Concept Design

### Concept 1: TransitRoutePlanner

**purpose** Plan and optimize multi-modal routes combining public transportation with hiking segments

**principle** Users specify a starting location, desired hiking area, and constraints; the system calculates the total available time, subtracts transit time, and finds the longest possible hiking route that fits within the remaining time, then plans the complete journey (transit → hiking → transit home)

**state**

* A set of TransitStops with location, name, and available routes
* A set of Trailheads with location, name, and connecting trails
* A set of PlannedRoutes with origin, destination, transit segments, hiking segments, and total duration
* A set of RouteConstraints with maxTravelTime, preferredDepartureTime, and accessibility requirements

**actions**

* planRoute(origin: Location, destination: Trailhead, constraints: RouteConstraints): (route: PlannedRoute)
  **requires** origin and destination are valid locations, constraints specify valid time limits
  **effects** calculates total available time, subtracts transit time, finds longest hiking route that fits, creates complete journey plan
* getAlternativeRoutes(route: PlannedRoute, criteria: String): (alternatives: Set(PlannedRoute))
  **requires** route exists and criteria is valid ("faster", "shorter", "scenic")
  **effects** returns set of alternative routes meeting the specified criteria
* updateRouteConstraints(route: PlannedRoute, newConstraints: RouteConstraints): (updatedRoute: PlannedRoute)
  **requires** route exists and newConstraints are valid
  **effects** recalculates route with new constraints, returns updated route or null if no valid route exists

### Concept 2: DynamicExitPlanner

**purpose** Provide real-time exit strategies and alternative return routes during active hikes

**principle** As users progress along a hike, the system continuously monitors their location and available exit options, suggesting optimal return routes based on current conditions and user state

**state**

* A set of ActiveHikes with current location, start time, and planned route
* A set of ExitPoints with location, accessibility, and transit connections
* A set of ExitStrategies with recommended exit point, transit route, and estimated arrival time

**actions**

* startHike(route: PlannedRoute, user: User): (hike: ActiveHike)
  **requires** route is valid and user is not already on an active hike
  **effects** creates new ActiveHike with current location set to trailhead, start time recorded
* updateLocation(hike: ActiveHike, newLocation: Location): (updatedHike: ActiveHike)
  **requires** hike is active and newLocation is valid
  **effects** updates hike's current location, recalculates available exit strategies based on new position
* getExitStrategies(hike: ActiveHike): (strategies: Set(ExitStrategy))
  **requires** hike is active
  **effects** returns set of possible exit strategies from current location, including transit connections and estimated arrival times
* endHike(hike: ActiveHike, exitPoint: ExitPoint): (completedHike: CompletedHike)
  **requires** hike is active and exitPoint is valid
  **effects** marks hike as completed, records end time and exit point, returns completed hike record

### Concept 3: ConstraintMonitor

**purpose** Monitor and integrate real-time constraints that affect route feasibility and safety

**principle** Continuously gather and process data about transit schedules, weather, daylight, and trail conditions to ensure planned routes remain viable and safe

**state**

* A set of TransitSchedules with route, stop, and time information
* A set of WeatherConditions with location, forecast, and current conditions
* A set of TrailConditions with trail status, closures, and difficulty ratings
* A set of ConstraintAlerts with affected routes and recommended actions

**actions**

* updateTransitSchedules(): (updatedSchedules: Set(TransitSchedule))
  **requires** none
  **effects** fetches latest transit schedule data from external sources, updates internal schedule state, returns set of updated schedules
* checkWeatherConditions(location: Location): (conditions: WeatherConditions)
  **requires** location is valid
  **effects** queries weather service for current and forecast conditions at location, returns weather data with timestamps
* getTrailConditions(trail: Trail): (conditions: TrailConditions)
  **requires** trail exists
  **effects** checks trail status (open/closed), difficulty ratings, and any reported issues, returns current trail conditions
* generateAlerts(route: PlannedRoute): (alerts: Set(ConstraintAlert))
  **requires** route exists
  **effects** analyzes route against current constraints (weather, transit, trail conditions), returns set of alerts for any issues found

### Concept 4: ExternalRoutingEngine

**purpose** Provide accurate routing and mapping calculations using external mapping services

**principle** Delegates complex routing calculations to specialized external services (like Valhalla, OpenRouteService, or Google Maps API) that can handle detailed network analysis, turn-by-turn directions, and real-time traffic data

**state**

* A set of RoutingRequests with origin, destination, mode, and constraints
* A set of RoutingResults with detailed paths, distances, durations, and turn-by-turn instructions
* A set of NetworkData with road networks, transit networks, and trail networks

**actions**

* calculateRoute(origin: Location, destination: Location, mode: String, constraints: Map): (result: RoutingResult)
  **requires** origin and destination are valid coordinates, mode is supported ("driving", "walking", "transit", "cycling")
  **effects** queries external routing service with parameters, returns detailed route with instructions and metadata
* getAlternativeRoutes(origin: Location, destination: Location, mode: String, maxAlternatives: Integer): (results: Set(RoutingResult))
  **requires** origin and destination are valid, maxAlternatives > 0
  **effects** requests multiple route options from external service, returns ranked set of alternatives
* updateNetworkData(): (updated: Boolean)
  **requires** none
  **effects** refreshes cached network data from external sources, returns true if updates were found

**notes**
This concept represents integration with external mapping services rather than building routing capabilities from scratch. Services like Valhalla, OpenRouteService, or commercial APIs provide the underlying routing engine that powers the transit and hiking route calculations.

### Essential Synchronizations

*These synchronizations ensure that route planning integrates real-time constraints and external routing data, that active hikes are monitored for safety issues, and that exit strategies are calculated using accurate routing information. The synchronizations create a cohesive system where planning, monitoring, and navigation work together seamlessly.*

**sync routePlanning**
when TransitRoutePlanner.planRoute(origin, destination, constraints)
then ConstraintMonitor.checkWeatherConditions(destination) and ConstraintMonitor.getTrailConditions(destination) and ExternalRoutingEngine.calculateRoute(origin, destination, "transit", constraints)

**sync hikeMonitoring**\
when DynamicExitPlanner.startHike(route, user)
then ConstraintMonitor.generateAlerts(route)

**sync constraintUpdates**
when ConstraintMonitor.updateTransitSchedules()
then TransitRoutePlanner.getAlternativeRoutes(affectedRoutes, "transit")

**sync exitRouteCalculation**
when DynamicExitPlanner.getExitStrategies(hike)
then ExternalRoutingEngine.calculateRoute(hike.currentLocation, exitPoint, "walking", {})

### Concept Integration Notes

The TransitRoutePlanner serves as the core planning engine, handling the complex optimization of multi-modal routes. The DynamicExitPlanner provides real-time safety and flexibility during active hikes, while the ConstraintMonitor ensures all planning remains current and safe. The TransitRoutePlanner's generic route type is instantiated with specific transit and hiking segments, while the DynamicExitPlanner's user type is bound to registered TrailLink users. The ConstraintMonitor operates independently but provides critical data to both other concepts through synchronizations.

## User Journey

Sarah, a graduate student living in Cambridge without a car, has been wanting to explore the Middlesex Fells Reservation but has been intimidated by the complex planning required to get there and back via public transportation. On a Saturday morning, she opens TrailLink and searches for hiking opportunities within 2 hours of her location.

The app presents her with several options, including a route to the Middlesex Fells that involves taking the Red Line to Alewife, then a bus to the trailhead, with a 4-mile loop hike and clear return instructions. Sarah selects this route and sees that the total journey will take about 3.5 hours, with 2.5 hours of actual hiking time.

As Sarah begins her hike, TrailLink's real-time monitoring shows her current location on the trail map. About halfway through, she notices dark clouds approaching and feels her energy waning. She checks the app, which immediately suggests three exit strategies: continuing to the planned endpoint (30 minutes), taking a shorter loop back to the trailhead (20 minutes), or using an emergency exit to a nearby road (10 minutes). The app shows that if she takes the emergency exit, she can catch a bus in 15 minutes that will get her home before the weather worsens.

Sarah chooses the emergency exit option and follows the app's turn-by-turn directions to the road, where she successfully catches the bus and returns home safely. The next day, she receives a notification from TrailLink asking about her experience and whether the suggested exit strategy worked well, helping improve the app's recommendations for future users.

This journey demonstrates how TrailLink transforms what would have been an impossible or dangerous situation into a manageable outdoor experience, enabling Sarah to safely enjoy nature despite not having a car and despite changing conditions during her hike.
