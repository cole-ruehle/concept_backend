# tests: Generate Deno tests AFTER impl for ConstraintMonitor

### Concept 3: ConstraintMonitor

**purpose** Monitor and integrate real-time constraints that affect route feasibility and safety

**principle** Continuously gather and process data about transit schedules, weather, daylight, and trail conditions to ensure planned routes remain viable and safe

**state**

* A set of TransitSchedules with route, stop, and time information
* A set of WeatherConditions with location, forecast, and current conditions
* A set of TrailConditions with trail status, closures, and difficulty ratings
* A set of ConstraintAlerts with affected routes and recommended actions

**actions**

* updateTransitSchedules(): (updatedSchedules: Set(TransitSchedule))
  **requires** none
  **effects** fetches latest transit schedule data from external sources, updates internal schedule state, returns set of updated schedules
* checkWeatherConditions(location: Location): (conditions: WeatherConditions)
  **requires** location is valid
  **effects** queries weather service for current and forecast conditions at location, returns weather data with timestamps
* getTrailConditions(trail: Trail): (conditions: TrailConditions)
  **requires** trail exists
  **effects** checks trail status (open/closed), difficulty ratings, and any reported issues, returns current trail conditions
* generateAlerts(route: PlannedRoute): (alerts: Set(ConstraintAlert))
  **requires** route exists
  **effects** analyzes route against current constraints (weather, transit, trail conditions), returns set of alerts for any issues found

## Goal

Create Deno tests:

* **Operational Principle (happy path):**
  1. Inject stub providers returning fixed transit schedules, weather, and trail data.
  2. `updateTransitSchedules()` returns ids; schedules exist in DB.
  3. `checkWeatherConditions(lat,lon)` returns weather id; summary has expected numbers.
  4. `getTrailConditions(trailId)` returns id; summary reflects stubbed status.
  5. `generateAlerts(plannedRouteId)` returns ≥1 id; top alert severity/message matches rules.
* **Interesting scenarios (3–5):**
  * Severe weather → high severity `"weather"` alert.
  * Transit headway too large or last departure elapsed → `"transit"` alert.
  * Trail closed → `"trail"` alert.
  * Daylight insufficient → `"daylight"` alert.
  * With LLM stub: `scoreSeverity` increases a “mixed” alert’s severity.
* No hidden state—seed via providers or direct inserts.
* Print inputs/outputs for legibility.
* Target: \[/src/concepts/ConstraintMonitor.test.ts]
* Assume `deno test -A`; include a comment for scoped perms.
