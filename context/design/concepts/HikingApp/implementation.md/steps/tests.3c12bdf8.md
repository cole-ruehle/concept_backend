# tests: Generate Deno tests AFTER impl for TransitRoutePlanner

### Concept 1: TransitRoutePlanner

**purpose** Plan and optimize multi-modal routes combining public transportation with hiking segments

**principle** Users specify a starting location, desired hiking area, and constraints; the system calculates the total available time, subtracts transit time, and finds the longest possible hiking route that fits within the remaining time, then plans the complete journey (transit → hiking → transit home)

**state**

* A set of TransitStops with location, name, and available routes
* A set of Trailheads with location, name, and connecting trails
* A set of PlannedRoutes with origin, destination, transit segments, hiking segments, and total duration
* A set of RouteConstraints with maxTravelTime, preferredDepartureTime, and accessibility requirements

**actions**

* planRoute(origin: Location, destination: Trailhead, constraints: RouteConstraints): (route: PlannedRoute)
  **requires** origin and destination are valid locations, constraints specify valid time limits
  **effects** calculates total available time, subtracts transit time, finds longest hiking route that fits, creates complete journey plan
* getAlternativeRoutes(route: PlannedRoute, criteria: String): (alternatives: Set(PlannedRoute))
  **requires** route exists and criteria is valid ("faster", "shorter", "scenic")
  **effects** returns set of alternative routes meeting the specified criteria
* updateRouteConstraints(route: PlannedRoute, newConstraints: RouteConstraints): (updatedRoute: PlannedRoute)
  **requires** route exists and newConstraints are valid
  **effects** recalculates route with new constraints, returns updated route or null if no valid route exists

## Goal

Create Deno tests:

* **Operational Principle (happy path):**
  1. Seed minimal `transit_stops` (two near origin & destination) and `trailheads` (destination with 2–3 connecting trails with minutes).
  2. Call `planRoute(...)` with reasonable `maxTravelMinutes`.
  3. Assert: totalMinutes = transit + hiking; hikingMinutes ≤ remaining; ids exist.
  4. `getPlannedRouteSummary(id)` prints a readable summary.
* **Interesting scenarios (pick 3–5):**
  * Tight time window → still feasible but shorter hike.
  * Zero/negative remaining time → `ValidationError`.
  * `getAlternativeRoutes(id, "faster")` returns different route id with `totalMinutes` ≤ original.
  * `"scenic"` criteria with mock LLM (stub `classify` to drive selection).
  * `updateRouteConstraints(id, smallerLimit)` → returns new id or `null` if impossible.
* No manual hidden state—seed via inserts or via allowed helper factory.
* Print inputs/outputs clearly.
* Target file: \[/src/concepts/TransitRoutePlanner.test.ts]
* Assume `deno test -A`; include comment showing how to scope permissions if desired.
